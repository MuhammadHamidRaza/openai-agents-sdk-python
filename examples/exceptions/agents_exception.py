"""
This example demonstrates the use of the OpenAI Agents SDK with tools and comprehensive error handling.

The agent, 'TriageAgent', is configured to handle two tasks:
- Fetching weather information for a specified city using the `get_weather` tool.
- Adding two numbers using the `sum_numbers` tool.

The agent is instructed to use only one tool per execution cycle and can switch to another tool in subsequent cycles. The example sets a `max_turns=1` limit to intentionally restrict the agent to a single turn, which may trigger a `MaxTurnsExceeded` error if the agent attempts multiple tool calls.

Error handling is implemented with `AgentsException`, which is the base class for all SDK-related exceptions, including:
- `MaxTurnsExceeded`: Raised when the run exceeds the `max_turns` specified in the run methods.
- `ModelBehaviorError`: Raised when the model produces invalid outputs, e.g., malformed JSON or using non-existent tools.
- `UserError`: Raised when the SDK user makes an error in code implementation.
- `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`: Raised when an input guardrail is violated (e.g., invalid or off-topic input).
- `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered`: Raised when an output guardrail is violated (e.g., invalid tool output).

Although this example does not include explicit guardrails, the structure supports adding input/output guardrails to validate user inputs or tool outputs. The `AgentsException` catch block ensures all SDK-related errors are handled gracefully.
